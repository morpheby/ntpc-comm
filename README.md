# NTPC-Comm #

Cross-platform communication framework for NTPC-metsys.
Uses 9-bit protocol.

### Notes ###

9-bit connectivity needs PL-2303 driver with parity check support. On OS X that
is one provided by [mpepping/osx-pl2303](https://github.com/mpepping/osx-pl2303/).

Windows support for parity check currently wasn't tested.
