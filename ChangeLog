	* CommHandler: Separated UNIX and Windows code. Windows code is not yet
	implemented.
	* Atom: Tried to change from util::Atom to std::atomic -- it happens, that one
	doesn't want to be used even with user-defined structs. Seems like GCC doesn't
	support it yet, linkage fails, asking for store() and load() specializations.
	* SerialComm: There is working implementation now of 9-bit serial reader and
	some tests for it.
